## Authors & Contributors

This book wouldn't be possible without the help of a large list of contributors who have been reviewing, writing and reporting bugs and stuff in the rizin project as well as in this book.

### The rizin book

This book was started by maijin as a new version of the original radare1 book written by pancake. It was updated and reworked significantly for the radare2.
With the rizin fork the book has been reworked again.
